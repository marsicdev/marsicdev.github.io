<p><q>Code is data, and data is code. The two are inextricably linked. The data in your genes is code. The floor plans for your house are code. The two concepts are actually indistinguishable, linked at a fundamental level by the idea of an Interpreter, which sits at the very heart of Computer Science. Metadata, on the other hand, is more like the kidney of Computer Science. In practice you can lose half of it and hardly notice.</q></p>
