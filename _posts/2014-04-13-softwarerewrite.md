In some ways, recreating a program is like remaking a movie — people have lots of expectations. With a remake, there are scenes people need to see, favorite lines they’re waiting to hear, and beloved characters you aren’t allowed to change. Your existing software may not have “fans” in the same sense, but it has a myriad of uses that people simply can’t live without. Have that in main when you plan your legacy software rewrite.
